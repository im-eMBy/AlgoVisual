## From author
A purely for fun project, started on one of the boring evenings after work :smirk:. Initialy, I created sorting visualization for few alghoritms, with use of React and up to 500 divs moving mulitple times every second :sweat_smile:. Although React handled that quite well, now sorting visualization is done with use of html canvas.
